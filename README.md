# bs-reactstrap

This is [Bucklescript](https://bucklescript.github.io/) bindings for [Reactstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/).
Currently they are autogenerated based on propTypes. Everything complex (basically not `string` or `bool`) is just type variable.
ðŸš§ It is not completed, we are adding bindings as we go. Doesn't follow semver at this point. ðŸš§

# Install, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ahrefs/bs-reactstrap)

```
yarn add @ahrefs/bs-reactstrap
```

# Setup

Add `@ahrefs/bs-reactstrap` to `bs-depenencies` in your `bsconfig.json`!

```js
{
  /* ... */
  "bs-dependencies": [
    "@ahrefs/bs-reactstrap"
  ],
  /* ... */
}
```

# Usage Example

```re
open BsReactstrap;

let component = ReasonReact.statelessComponent("SomeComponent");

let make = (~onChange, _children) => {
  ...component,

  render: _self => {
    <Button color="primary" size="lg" onClick=(_e => Js.log("Hi!"))>
      Hello
    </Button>
  }
};
```

Check [Reactstrap documentation](https://reactstrap.github.io/components/) for available props.
